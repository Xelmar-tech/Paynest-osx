# Project Rules
- All project operations should be done via the Makefile
- Use the following make commands:
  - `make test` - Run all unit tests locally
  - `make test-coverage` - Generate HTML coverage report under ./report
  - `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
  - `make init` - Check and install dependencies
  - `make sync-tests` - Scaffold or sync tree files into solidity tests
  - `make check-tests` - Check if solidity files are out of sync
  - `make markdown-tests` - Generate markdown file with test definitions

# Testing Rules
- Always run tests after making changes to the code using `make test`
- Check test coverage using `make test-coverage` when adding new functionality
- Keep test coverage above 80% for critical contract functionality
- Write tests for both success and failure cases
- Use the test utilities in test/util/ for common testing patterns

# Development Rules
- Initialize project dependencies with `make init` before starting development
- Clean build artifacts with `make clean` when switching branches or after failed builds
- Use `make sync-tests` when adding new test files
- Check test synchronization with `make check-tests` before committing changes

# Deployment Rules
- Use `make pre-deploy-testnet` to simulate testnet deployment
- Use `make deploy-testnet` for actual testnet deployment and verification
- Use `make pre-deploy-prodnet` to simulate production deployment
- Use `make deploy-prodnet` for actual production deployment and verification
